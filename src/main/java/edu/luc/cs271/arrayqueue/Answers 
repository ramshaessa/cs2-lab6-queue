Why does FixedArrayQueue require an explicit constructor?
Maximum length of the queue is specified by the argument in the constructor. 
What happens when you offer an item to a full FixedArrayQueue?
Same as Addlast to the queue. It returns true or false. 
What happens when you poll an empty FixedArrayQueue?
It returns null 
What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the FixedArrayQueue methods?
Time complexity for offer and poll is O(log(n)) and for peek is O(1). Space complexity is O(1).
